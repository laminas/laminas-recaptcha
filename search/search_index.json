Many of us have friends, family and colleagues in both Russia and Ukraine. Some of us were born in Russia. Some of us currently live in Russia. Some have grandparents who fought Nazis in World War II. Nobody here supports fascism. One team member has a Ukrainian relative who fled her home with her son. The train was delayed due to bombing on the road ahead. We have friends who are hiding in bomb shelters. We anxiously follow up on them after the air raids, which indiscriminately fire at hospitals, schools, kindergartens and houses. We're not taking this from any media. These are our actual experiences. You trust us enough to use our software. We ask that you trust us to say the truth on this. We need your help. Go out and protest this unnecessary war.

Each reCAPTCHA requires the user to input two words, the first of which is the actual CAPTCHA, and the second of which is a word from some scanned text that Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software has been unable to identify. The assumption is that if a user correctly provides the first word, the second is likely correctly entered as well, and can be used to improve OCR software for digitizing books.
